## History

Our school, Hwa Chong Robotics Club (HCRC), has been a consistent participant in the RoboCup competition since its inception in Singapore in 2009. While we initially achieved some notable results in the early years of our participation, over time our performance began to suffer, with our robots often incomplete or struggling to function properly.

Despite these setbacks, we refused to give up, and continued to work tirelessly to improve our designs and programming. Finally, in 2018, our perseverance paid off, as we were able to secure a 1st place finish in both Soccer Lightweight and Rescue Line, as well as 2nd and 3rd place finishes in Soccer Open - our best showing yet.

The following year, in the midst of the COVID pandemic, our all-star team Transcendence took home 1st place in Soccer Open, a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team members. And in 2022, another HCRC team, ThiccWires, proved that our success was no fluke, as they too secured a 1st place finish in Soccer Open.

Now for our story,

In 2021, we found ourselves facing a significant challenge as we were suddenly without the guidance of our mentor team, Transcendence, due to the COVID pandemic. While the loss of their guidance was certainly a setback, we refused to give up on our dreams of achieving success in the RoboCup competition. Instead, we took inspiration from our school's core value of "自强不息" (perseverance) and resolved to take matters into our own hands.

With this determination driving us forward, we formed a new team, Sentinels Robotics, and set our sights on improving ourselves and pushing ourselves to be the very best we could be. Despite the many obstacles that lay ahead, we remained steadfast in our commitment to excellence, and refused to be deterred by the challenges that lay ahead.

I would not say that we are the sucessors of Transcendence, but rather, we are the next generation of HCRC. We are Sentinels Robotics.
