## History

RoboCup Junior Soccer was first introduced in Singapore back in 2009, with our club only participating in the Soccer Open category. Our first taste of success came in 2011, where we managed to clinch first place in Open League B and represented Singapore at RoboCup Istanbul.

In 2018, our perseverance paid off, as we were able to 2nd and 3rd for Soccer Open. The Lightweight team went on to represent Team Singapore at RoboCup Montreal and finished 8th (Individual).

After a disappointing 2019 run and Robocup being cancelled in 2020 due to the pandemic, we managed to obtain commendable results in the virtually held Nationals in 2021, with Team Transcendence being one of two teams selected to represent Singapore for Soccer Open at Robocup Worldwide. The team eventually came in 1st, 5th and 7th respectively in the technical challenges.

In 2022, Robocup finally returned to a physical format as Singapore’s COVID-19 situation improved. For the first time since 2011, our club emerged champions in Soccer Open, winning the Finals in a decisive 11-5 match despite facing numerous hardware problems on the competition day.

Now for our story,

In 2021, we found ourselves facing a significant challenge as we were suddenly without the guidance of our mentor team, Transcendence, as all of them has graduated. While the loss of their guidance was certainly a setback, we refused to give up on our dreams of achieving success in the RoboCup competition. Instead, we took inspiration from our school's core value of "自强不息" (perseverance) and resolved to take matters into our own hands.

With this determination driving us forward, we formed a new team, Sentinels Robotics, and set our sights on improving ourselves and pushing ourselves to be the very best we could be. Despite the many obstacles that lay ahead, we remained steadfast in our commitment to excellence, and refused to be deterred by the challenges that lay ahead.

We are delighted to be able to represent Singapore in the 2023 season of RoboCup after a long haitus due to COVID restrictions.

## Our Philosophy

> We believe that the best way to learn is to do, and that the best way to do is to fail, even if our robot goes up into flames.
