## History

RoboCup Junior Soccer was first introduced in Singapore back in 2009, with our club only participating in the Soccer Open category. Our first taste of success came in 2011, where we managed to clinch first place in Open League B and represented Singapore at RoboCup Istanbul.

In 2018, our perseverance paid off, as we were able to 2nd and 3rd for Soccer Open. The Lightweight team went on to represent Team Singapore at RoboCup Montreal and finished 8th (Individual).

After a disappointing 2019 run and Robocup being cancelled in 2020 due to the pandemic, we managed to obtain commendable results in the virtually held Nationals in 2021, with Team Transcendence being one of two teams selected to represent Singapore for Soccer Open at Robocup Worldwide. The team eventually came in 1st, 5th and 7th respectively in the technical challenges.

In 2022, Robocup finally returned to a physical format as Singapore’s COVID-19 situation improved. For the first time since 2011, our club emerged champions in Soccer Open, winning the Finals in a decisive 11-5 match despite facing numerous hardware problems on the competition day.

Now for our story,

In 2021, we found ourselves facing a significant challenge as we were suddenly without the guidance of our mentor team, Transcendence, as all of them has graduated. While the loss of their guidance was certainly a setback, we refused to give up on our dreams of achieving success in the RoboCup competition. Instead, we took inspiration from our school's core value of "自强不息" (perseverance) and resolved to take matters into our own hands.

With this determination driving us forward, we formed a new team, Sentinels Robotics, and set our sights on improving ourselves and pushing ourselves to be the very best we could be. Despite the many obstacles that lay ahead, we remained steadfast in our commitment to excellence, and refused to be deterred by the challenges that lay ahead.

We are delighted to be able to represent Singapore in the 2023 season of RoboCup after a long haitus due to COVID restrictions.

## Our Values

> What sets our team apart is that on top of the typical values of innovation and perseverance, we closely live by our own two core values: self-directedness and versatility

### Self-directedness

We take great pride in being the **ONLY** club in Singapore that has never employed a coach since our inception. Every step of the robot's construction process, from the initial design to the final lines of code in our program, is executed entirely by our team without any external assistance. Our unwavering commitment to self-directedness has certainly not made our journey an easy one and has resulted in some spectacular failures on multiple occasions. Nevertheless, we remain steadfast in our resolve to do everything ourselves, for we believe that we should take full responsibility for our learning and hold ourselves fully accountable for the results we achieve, whether they be good or bad.

### Versatility

We pride ourselves on being expert generalists, with each team member specializing in multiple areas while maintaining a certain level of understanding in all other areas. This approach is rooted in the belief that it is crucial for every team member to understand their role fully, ensuring that the absence of any one member does not hinder the team's progress. By fostering a culture of cross-functional knowledge and collaboration, we are able to operate at the highest level of efficiency and effectiveness, pushing the boundaries of what is possible and achieving unprecedented success.
