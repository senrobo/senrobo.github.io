## History

Our school, Hwa Chong Robotics Club (HCRC), has been a consistent participant in the RoboCup competition since its inception in Singapore in 2009. While we initially achieved some notable results in the early years of our participation, over time our performance began to suffer, with our robots often incomplete or struggling to function properly.

Despite these setbacks, we refused to give up, and continued to work tirelessly to improve our designs and programming. Finally, in 2018, our perseverance paid off, as we were able to secure a 1st place finish in both Soccer Lightweight and Rescue Line, as well as 2nd and 3rd place finishes in Soccer Open - our best showing yet.

The following year, in the midst of the COVID pandemic, our all-star team Transcendence took home 1st place in Soccer Open, a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team members. And in 2022, another HCRC team, ThiccWires as they too secured a 1st place finish in Soccer Open.

Now for our story,

In 2021, we found ourselves facing a significant challenge as we were suddenly without the guidance of our mentor team, Transcendence, due to the COVID pandemic. While the loss of their guidance was certainly a setback, we refused to give up on our dreams of achieving success in the RoboCup competition. Instead, we took inspiration from our school's core value of "自强不息" (perseverance) and resolved to take matters into our own hands.

With this determination driving us forward, we formed a new team, Sentinels Robotics, and set our sights on improving ourselves and pushing ourselves to be the very best we could be. Despite the many obstacles that lay ahead, we remained steadfast in our commitment to excellence, and refused to be deterred by the challenges that lay ahead.

We would not say that we are the sucessors of Transcendence, but rather, we are the next generation of HCRC. We are Sentinels Robotics.

## Our Philosophy

> We believe that the best way to learn is to do, and that the best way to do is to fail, even if our robot goes up into flames.

## Our Values

> What sets our team apart is that on top of the typical values of innovation and perseverance, we closely live by our own two core values: self-directedness and versatility

### Self-directedness

We take great pride in being the **ONLY** club in Singapore that has never employed a coach since our inception. Every step of the robot's construction process, from the initial design to the final lines of code in our program, is executed entirely by our team without any external assistance. Our unwavering commitment to self-directedness has certainly not made our journey an easy one and has resulted in some spectacular failures on multiple occasions. Nevertheless, we remain steadfast in our resolve to do everything ourselves, for we believe that we should take full responsibility for our learning and hold ourselves fully accountable for the results we achieve, whether they be good or bad.

### Versatility

We pride ourselves on being expert generalists, with each team member specializing in multiple areas while maintaining a certain level of understanding in all other areas. This approach is rooted in the belief that it is crucial for every team member to understand their role fully, ensuring that the absence of any one member does not hinder the team's progress. By fostering a culture of cross-functional knowledge and collaboration, we are able to operate at the highest level of efficiency and effectiveness, pushing the boundaries of what is possible and achieving unprecedented success.
