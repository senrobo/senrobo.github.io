Our stackup was very simple, consisting of just 4 layers. The first layer was responsible for all the high-power electronics and our kicker system. The second layer was made of carbon fiber purely for mounting our servo carbon fiber plate and the battery. The third layer was for our main processing, while the fourth layer was for our robot vision system. Some problems with this stackup included that the sides were practically exposed, as we completely cut off layer 2 to save weight, which did not comply with the rules. Additionally,using long standoffs was not a good idea as they did not hold onto the layers properly, and the robot's screws often wobbled out during testing. In the end, the robot was quite heavy, almost tipping the weight limit due to the inclusion of a dribbler and a kicker system. So we just removed it completely in the final version

The kicker was driven by a small servo and a screw attached at the back, and it had guard rails to prevent it from jiggling around too much. A rubber band is used in place to quickly retract the kicker back to its original position. How it works is that a spiral-ish slip gear, where after a certain distance, the screw will just 'slip' away from the spiral. The spiral was designed around the idea of the Fibonacci Spiral.

During testing, we realized that our MG90S servo was not powerful enough to overcome the strong elastic potential energy of the rubber bands, and it often snapped. The long body of the kicker and its mounts also caused a lot of energy to be lost to friction, resulting in very little power being transferred to the ball. Therefore, we decided to scrap the kicker system to save weight and to focus on other aspects of the robot.

When it came time to design our mirror, we had to take into account two critical factors: weight and clarity. In order to achieve the optimal balance between these two objectives, we first had to decide which type of mirror to use - a conic or parabolic mirror. For those who may be unfamiliar with the differences between these two options, a helpful comparison can be found [here](https://bozo.infocommsociety.com/open/mech/mirror/).

After much deliberation and careful analysis, we ultimately chose to utilize a conic mirror, as this option offered the ideal combination of weight savings and ease of manufacture. Additionally, we determined that a conic mirror would be more than adequate for our needs, as we did not require the ability to see objects in close proximity to the robot. Ultimately, our decision paid off, as we were able to create a mirror that was both lightweight and exceptionally clear, allowing our robot to perform at its best on the competition field.

During the building process, we initially hoped to utilize our senior's tried-and-true method of hollowing out a solid block of aluminum in order to reduce weight and achieve a more optimal design for our mirror. However, upon further analysis, we quickly realized that this approach would be prohibitively expensive, costing upwards of S$1000.

Undaunted, we put our heads together and devised a novel solution, leveraging 3D printing technology to create a mirror mold that would allow us to create a lightweight and highly efficient mirror using a mirror sheet. Thanks to our innovative approach, we were able to circumvent the high costs and weight issues associated with our original plan, while still achieving a mirror that was free from distortion and other imperfections.üëç
