## Background

In the past, our team was known as Team UwU Robotics, and this year marked our inaugural foray into the fiercely competitive world of Robocup Junior Soccer Lightweight. As relative newcomers to this highly complex and challenging field, we found ourselves somewhat daunted by the sheer level of expertise and skill required to succeed.

Prior to this, our experience had been largely limited to Lego Competitions, such as the World Robo Olympiad (WRO) and First Lego League (FLL), which left us unprepared for the unique demands of Robocup Soccer. Nonetheless, we approached the challenge with a sense of determination and an eagerness to learn, drawing inspiration from the design philosophy of our senior mentors, while also adding our own creative twists to the mix.
