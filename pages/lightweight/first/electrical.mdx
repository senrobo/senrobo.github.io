## Schematic

Regrettably, in our eagerness to get started on the project, we initially opted to rely on a schematic that was a direct copy of that of our senior team. While this approach did yield some positive results, it also led to the inclusion of certain design elements that were ultimately deemed problematic, such as the inclusion of a mouse sensor and Time-Of-Flight (TOF) sensors, which were actually prohibited by the competition rules.

While we recognized these issues, we initially hesitated to make significant changes to the design, as we were concerned that doing so might negatively impact the robot's performance. However, as we continued to work on the project, we ultimately came to realize that it was essential to ensure full compliance with all competition rules and regulations, even if that meant making some tough design choices along the way.

## PCB Design

In retrospect, we recognize that our PCB design process took far too long, and that we failed to give adequate consideration to some of the most critical design considerations. For example, we neglected to properly place decoupling capacitors in close proximity to the relevant ICs, and we inadvertently allowed signal traces to come into close proximity with high-powered traces, potentially leading to signal interference and other issues.
