## Overview

This year, our team has made significant strides in the development of our robot, implementing a range of cutting-edge enhancements to bolster its efficiency and robustness. Among these upgrades, we have integrated a powerful mechanism for kicking. Moreover, we have upgraded to the lightning-fast Teensy 4.0, which processes data with unparalleled efficiency compared to its predecessor, the Teensy 3.6.
