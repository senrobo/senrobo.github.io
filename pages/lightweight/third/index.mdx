## Overview

This year, our team has made significant strides in the development of our robot, implementing a range of cutting-edge enhancements to bolster its efficiency and robustness. Among these upgrades, we have integrated a powerful solenoid mechanism for kicking, and reinforced the structure with a sleek and resilient carbon fiber plate. Moreover, we have upgraded to the lightning-fast Teensy 4.0, which processes data with unparalleled efficiency compared to its predecessor, the Teensy 3.6.

But perhaps the most transformative improvement this year is our adoption of the SeeedStudio Xiao ESP32-C3, which will allow us to achieve even greater levels of sophistication in our programming, enabling us to execute complex strategies and formations with ease, and putting on an even more captivating performance than ever before. With the addition of the solenoid, our robot is now better equipped than ever to score goals with precision and agility.
