## Base Design

As with other years, we decided to stick with the same layer stack-up concept due to its modularity and lightweight characteristics. The first layer is responsible for mounting most of the high powered components such as the motor drivers, while the second layer is made of carbon fiber and it is used as a buffer layer to ensure that the sensitive electronics are not mounted too closely to the motors. The third layer is for our main processing, while the fourth layer is for our mirror.

## Components

### Kicker

The solenoid 0837B is chosen because it had the perfect balance between weight and strength

### Mirror

We used the same mirror as past years

### Cover

We have devised a sophisticated solution to address the issue of safeguarding the sensitive electronics of the initial layer. In lieu of the unwieldy and unsightly approach of affixing plastic covers through glue and zip-ties, we have opted to fabricate 3D-printed covers that can be seamlessly clipped onto the stand-offs. This ingeniously engineered clipping mechanism not only ensures a modular robot, but also facilitates effortless attachment and detachment of the covers as required.

### Wheels

Same as any other years. We 3D printed the wheels and rollers and assembled them. We chose to create our own wheels because of the flexibility it gives us (i.e. can choose any diameter, shape) and also because of how resistant it is to wear and tear.
