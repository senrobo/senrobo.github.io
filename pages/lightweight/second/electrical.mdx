## Schematics

The Schematics was untouched becuase we did not have the time to learn both mechanical and electrical within a short timespan.

We removed the mouse sensor as we realise that it was 1. Too difficult to interface and 2. It was very expensive to own one so we ditched the idea allowing more room to place traces on the PCB more efficently. We also removed the ultrasonic sensor as during testing we found out that the reading of the HC-SR04 was not accurate enough and way too slow to be reliably trusted to be used for localization. 

## PCB Design

Instead of placing the majority of components on the top layer, such as the STM32 and MUX, we decided to position them on the underside of the PCB to simplify wiring. Although some of our esteemed colleagues expressed concern that the proximity of the STM32 to the ground might result in it becoming scratched or torn off, we ensured that we allowed for sufficient clearance to avoid any significant issues.

In our pursuit of optimizing board spacing and layout, we attempted to condense the wiring into a smaller space. However, in doing so, we inadvertently placed tracks too close to one another and vias in close proximity to large pads. For instance, we encountered an issue with our motor driver due to our placement of a via next to a substantial pad. This caused a short circuit in the motor driver, and initially, we were unaware of the root cause of the problem, resulting in repeated instances of the VNH5019 burning out.

Here you can see that the pads were so close to the via that it caused a short when the pads is shifted slightly out of alignment.
