## Background

_From a inital four man team has now became a duo. What will the future hold for these young aspiring robotics members?_

## Planning

This year we wanted to focus on learning the fundamentals of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. Thus we set on a 2 year plan where this year would be a testing year/phase to test our knowledge on these concepts.

Some changes we thought on improving from last years robot

- Use a spring system instead of a rubber band system for kicker
- Improve structural integrity of the robot
- Use less parts (both Mech and Elec)
