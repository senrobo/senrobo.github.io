## Layer Stackup

### Layer 1

- Layer 1 is not changed much from last year with most of the heavy components being mounted on Layer 1

### Layer 2

- Layer 2 is now a Ground Plane instead of a Carbon Fiber Plate to hopefully block off some of the Magnetic Field Waves from messing with our BNO055 IMU
- The kicker is also now mounted on Layer 2

### Layer 3

- Had a better 5 Point Connection as compared to last year hopefully to prevent the camera from shaking too much and have a improve camera quality

### Layer 4

- A 3D Printed Mirror Layer
