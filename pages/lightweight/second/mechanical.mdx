## Layer Stackup

### Layer 1

Layer 1 is not changed much from last year with most of the heavy components being mounted on Layer 1

### Layer 2

Layer 2 is now a Ground Plane instead of a Carbon Fiber Plate to hopefully block off some of the Magnetic Field Waves from messing with our BNO055 IMU. This was an idea suggested by our senior, however, we could just not use the magnometer on the sensor and it will still work as well
The kicker is also now mounted on Layer 2 as there is a lack of space on Layer 1

### Layer 3

Had a better 5 Point Connection as compared to last year hopefully to prevent the camera from shaking too much and have a improve camera quality. This was proved to be useless as the camera still shakes a lot regardless of a 5 Point or a 4 Point Connection as the shaking primarily comes from using a single layered wheel stackup instead of a dual layer wheel stack up.

### Layer 4

A 3D Printed Mirror Layer to save weight
