## Objective
We wanted to find a set of wheels that can ensure that the movment of the robot is smooth so that it does not shake and disrub the image on the mirror. The 2 main factors are the number of rollers on the wheels and the layers on the wheels.

## Why Does 2 Layer Wheels Provide A Smoother Image?

When double wheels are stacked its is like increasing the contact points on the floor. Think about the 2 sided polygon when stacked ontop each ofther and offsetssed by a certain angle, this will increase the number of contact points of the wheels to the ground, forming a nicer circle.

TODO: Add more pictured and be more descrptive

## Final Decision

In the end, we decided to use the single layered wheels as we realised that there was little space in the robot and we could not afford having to stack 2 wheels ontop of each other.
