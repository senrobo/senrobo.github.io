## Component Changes
For the light ring on layer 1, the LEDs has been changed from the 5050 Package to the newer and thinner 2835 Package. The 5730 package was considered however, it was difficult to solder the back pad without using a heating plate making repairing the led difficult.

Instead of having multiple connectors to connect the power cables between Layer 1 and Layer 2, a single XH2.54mm 4 Pin connector is used and the 3A current rating was enough for our use case.

Instead of using the STP75NF75 MOSFET, we have replaced it using the Infineon ... which was better performance as it efficeincy is better than the STP75NF75 thus, producing less heat when the MOSFET is turned on.

## Positioning Changes
The Boost Converter on Layer 1 was shifted from Layer 1 to Layer 2 for better protection of the overall circuit. So that the likelihood of the boost shorting was kept minimized. 

## Conclusion
Our senior is not very happy that we have to rebuy a new printed circuit board but owell, the more you f*** around the more you find you ðŸ¤·.
