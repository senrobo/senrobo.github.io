heres a brief outline of what has been changed mechanically today.

## PCB Offset and Cover Extension

the pcb is easily damaged when hit from the side, which has a risk of exposing the copper after continuous ramming. thus, the dxf file for all 3 layers are offsetted inwards by 1mm and the and the cover is extended downwards and/or upwards to fill the gap. this ensures there is a layer of hard plastic protecting the edges of the pcb. 

## Standoff Stabilisation

the 90mm (but currently 110mm) standoffs are wobbly when shaken, with the bot held still, so i added extensions/arms on both side of the tof holder with cross bracing, which wraps around the side standoffs and prevents the standoffs from slanting to each side too much.
